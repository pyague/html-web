    <p>Somerset is a veteran detective who is about to retire and who meets the young policeman Mills. <br>
        Together they must investigate the murder of an obese man who has been tied up and forced to eat to death. <br>
        The crimes take place while the two detectives show their opposite moods, one patient and rational, and the <br>
        more impetuous young man.</p>
    <p><strong>Brad Pitt</strong> and <strong>Morgan Freeman</strong></p>
