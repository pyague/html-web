    <p>Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same <br>
        name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the <br>
        don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable <br>
        cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, <br>
        Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.</p>
