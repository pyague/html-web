    <p>The Lord of the Rings, a shy young hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a simple gold ring. <br>
        He knows the ring has power, but not that he alone holds the secret to the survival--or enslavement--of the <br>
        entire world. Now Frodo, accompanied by a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, two men and three loyal hobbit friends, <br>
        must become the greatest hero the world has ever known to save the land and the people he loves.</p>
    <p><strong>Elijah Wood</strong> and <strong>Orlando Bloom</strong></p>
