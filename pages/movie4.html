    <p>Pepa and Iván are dubbing actors. He is an inveterate womanizer and, after a long relationship, he breaks up <br>
        with Pepa: he leaves her a message on the answering machine asking her to pack a suitcase with his things. <br>
        Pepa, who can't stand living in a house full of memories, decides to rent it out. <br>
        While waiting for Iván to pick up his suitcase, his house fills up with extravagant people from whom <br>
        he will learn many things about loneliness and madness.</p>
